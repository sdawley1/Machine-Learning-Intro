# Machine-Learning-Intro

The objective of this assignment was to gain some experience with the Keras API for training a neural network and compare the machine learning approach to a more traditional statistical analysis approaches. Notably, the objective was to determine the fuel efficiency of a car given certain characteristics about the machine such as horsepower and mileage. 

The data was taken from [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression), alongside the neural network in the latter part of the document. I'd like to reiterate that I take no credit for creating that model myself.

Much of everything else I learned about regarding random forests and boosting within machine learning methods came from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-random-forest-is-my-favorite-machine-learning-model-b97651fa3706#:~:text=Random%20forest%20handles%20outliers%20by,indifferent%20to%20non%2Dlinear%20features.&text=It%20has%20methods%20for%20balancing%20error%20in%20class%20population%20unbalanced%20data%20sets.) and [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/voting-ensembles-with-python/), in some very helpful blog posts.

As far as the actual assignment was concerned, I don't think I did the whole "traditional statistical methods" part very well, ASIDE from the simple linear model, but even that didn't do a great job. That being said, I learned a lot about machine learning and had fun putting everything together and troubleshooting problems and bugs as they arose :). Also, I realized how user-friendly [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is!
